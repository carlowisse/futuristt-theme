# Futuristt for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com)
Futuristt is a very dark theme with a cyberpunk inspired syntax highlighting system, matrix style terminal and minimal user interface design principals.

I will be optimising and upgrading this theme as I use it every day. Should you have any requests or fixes, please email at: contact@carlowisse.com
